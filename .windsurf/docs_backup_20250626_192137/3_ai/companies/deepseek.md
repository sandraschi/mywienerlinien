# DeepSeek AI

## Overview
DeepSeek is a highly regarded Chinese artificial intelligence company that emerged with a clear mission: to pursue AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) by developing powerful, open-source large language models. The company quickly gained international recognition by releasing a series of high-performance models that not only rivaled but, in some benchmarks, surpassed leading open-source and even some proprietary models. Their strategy focuses on transparency and community contribution, positioning them as a key player in the global open-source AI movement.

## Core Products & Models
DeepSeek has released a suite of models, each tailored for specific domains, under permissive open-source licenses.

### DeepSeek LLM
This is their flagship line of general-purpose language models, designed for a wide range of natural language understanding and generation tasks.
- **Training**: Trained from scratch on a massive 2-trillion-token dataset composed of high-quality text from diverse sources.
- **Models**: Released in various sizes, including 7B and 67B parameter versions, to cater to different computational budgets.
- **Performance**: The 67B model, in particular, has shown performance comparable to other leading models like Llama 2 70B.

### DeepSeek Coder
A series of specialized code-generation models, trained to be expert software development assistants.
- **Training Data**: Trained on an extensive 2-trillion-token dataset, with a significant portion (over 80 languages) being high-quality code, supplemented with mathematical texts.
- **Capabilities**: Excels at code completion, bug fixing, generating unit tests, and translating code between languages.
- **Performance**: Has consistently ranked at the top of leaderboards for code generation tasks, outperforming many other open-source code models.

### DeepSeek-VL (Visual Language)
A multimodal model that combines language understanding with visual perception.
- **Capabilities**: Can understand and process both text and images, allowing it to answer questions about images, describe visual scenes, and perform other vision-language tasks.
- **Architecture**: Integrates a vision encoder with the DeepSeek LLM to process visual information.

## Technology & Philosophy
DeepSeek's success is built on a few key technological and strategic pillars.

- **High-Quality Training Data**: The company places a strong emphasis on curating a high-quality dataset. They employ rigorous filtering and data-cleaning pipelines to remove low-quality or toxic content, which they believe is crucial for building robust and capable models.
- **Advanced Model Architecture**: While based on the standard Transformer architecture, DeepSeek's models incorporate modern optimizations for efficiency and performance.
- **Open-Source Commitment**: A core part of DeepSeek's strategy is to release its powerful models under licenses like the MIT License or a custom permissive license. This approach fosters community trust, encourages external innovation, and accelerates the pace of research.
- **Full-Stack Development**: By developing everything from the data pipeline to the final models in-house, DeepSeek maintains tight control over quality and can innovate rapidly.

## Market Significance & Impact
DeepSeek's emergence is significant for several reasons:
- **Challenging the Status Quo**: They have proven that a relatively new and lean company can produce state-of-the-art models, challenging the dominance of larger, more established AI labs.
- **Raising the Bar for Open-Source**: By releasing exceptionally powerful models for free, they have raised the performance baseline for the entire open-source community.
- **Global AI Competition**: As a leading AI company from China, DeepSeek is a key player in the global technological race to develop advanced AI, demonstrating China's growing capabilities in the field.
