research: Windsurf Teams Plan, Conversation Sharing, and Export Limitations :research

## Windsurf Teams Plan
- **What is it?** A paid plan ($30/user/month) for groups/orgs, unlocking advanced features: Cascade conversation sharing, admin analytics, centralized billing, and enhanced memory.
- **How to get it:** Sign up at [windsurf.com/pricing](https://windsurf.com/pricing), choose Teams, invite users, and set up billing. SSO and enterprise controls are available or coming soon.
- **Enterprise tier:** $60/user/month, adds more credits, RBAC, SSO, and volume discounts.

## Cascade Conversation Sharing: What Does It Actually Do?
- **How it works:** In Teams/Enterprise, you can click `...` (options) in the Cascade panel and select “Share Conversation.”
- **What is shared?** This generates a secure link to your Cascade trajectory (the full conversation, agentic steps, and context) **inside the Windsurf platform**.
- **Who can access?** Only users in your org/team with the link can view the shared Cascade session. It is NOT a public URL or exportable file.
- **Lock-in:** This is a Windsurf-internal feature. The link opens the Cascade session in the Windsurf UI for other team members. There is currently **no way to export the full session to markdown, PDF, or a portable format**—the lock-in continues.
- **Why?** This design keeps all agentic context, code, and history inside Windsurf, supporting collaboration but not true data portability.

## User Frustrations and Limitations
- **No export:** Users cannot download or export complete Cascade sessions. Sharing is only via internal link for Teams/Enterprise.
- **Long-term memory:** Persistent, automatic long-term memory is also limited to Teams/Enterprise, and even then is not fully automatic or portable.
- **Summary:** Many users find this limiting, especially those wanting to archive, migrate, or analyze their agentic workflows outside Windsurf.
