**Description:**
After discovering vibe coding with windsurf, I went into this rabbithole and did 20 hour programming benders and forgot to eat, resulting in a hypoglycemic episode. I found the glucose tablet in time but this addictive behaviour worries me. What will the future hold, and will I end up bankrupt because of the Codeium bill?
