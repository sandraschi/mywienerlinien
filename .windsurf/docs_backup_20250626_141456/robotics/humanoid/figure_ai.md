## Key Robots

### Figure 01
Figure 01 is the company's first autonomous humanoid robot. It is designed to be a general-purpose platform capable of performing a wide variety of tasks in human environments.

- **Design**: Electrically actuated, human-like form factor (height, weight, and payload capacity) designed to operate in spaces built for people.
- **AI System**: Figure's AI system is designed for end-to-end learning. It leverages a combination of learned policies and teleoperation data. The collaboration with OpenAI aims to give Figure 01 advanced vision and language capabilities, allowing it to understand and execute complex verbal commands.
- **Capabilities**: Recent demonstrations have shown Figure 01 performing tasks like making coffee, putting away dishes, and handling plastic bins, all based on verbal instructions and visual learning.
- **Applications**: The initial target application is in automotive manufacturing (with BMW), performing tasks like logistics, material handling, and general warehouse operations.

## Core Technology & Approach

- **AI-First Robotics**: Figure's strategy is fundamentally centered on AI. They believe that breakthroughs in AI are the key to unlocking the potential of humanoid robots. Their partnership with OpenAI is a cornerstone of this approach.
- **Data Generation Engine**: Figure utilizes a robust data generation system, including simulation and human teleoperation, to train its AI models quickly and effectively.
- **Hardware-Software Co-design**: The robot's hardware (actuators, sensors, hands) and the AI software are developed in tight integration to create a seamless and capable system.
- **Emphasis on Commercialization**: From its inception, Figure has focused on a clear path to commercial deployment, targeting specific, high-value use cases in industries facing labor challenges.

## Impact and Future Direction
Figure has rapidly emerged as a major contender in the humanoid robotics race, largely due to its high-profile partnerships (BMW, OpenAI) and significant funding. Their focus on leveraging large-scale AI models to solve robotics challenges sets them apart. The company's future direction is aimed at scaling the deployment of Figure 01 in manufacturing and logistics, with the long-term goal of creating a general-purpose workforce that can be deployed across various sectors of the economy.
