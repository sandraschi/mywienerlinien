# Anthropic

## Overview
Anthropic is an AI safety and research company structured as a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC). Founded by former senior members of OpenAI, the company's core mission is to ensure that artificial general intelligence (AGI) is developed in a way that benefits humanity. This safety-first approach permeates their research, product development, and corporate structure. They are best known for their family of large language models, **Claude**, and their pioneering training technique, **Constitutional AI**.

## Core Philosophy: AI Safety & Alignment
Anthropic's research is guided by the goal of making AI systems more reliable, interpretable, and steerable.
- **Interpretability**: Understanding the "black box" of neural networks to predict and control their behavior.
- **Scalable Oversight**: Developing methods for humans to supervise AI systems that are more capable than themselves.
- **Constitutional AI**: A framework for aligning AI behavior with human values without constant human supervision.

## Constitutional AI: Training with Principles
This is Anthropic's flagship technique for instilling values into an AI model. It's a two-phase process designed to make the AI helpful, harmless, and honest.
1.  **Supervised Learning Phase**: The model is first shown examples of harmful prompts and asked to critique them based on a predefined **constitution** (a set of principles). It then revises its own responses based on these principles. This teaches the model the *reasoning* behind the rules.
2.  **Reinforcement Learning Phase**: The model generates responses that are then compared against the constitution. An AI, rather than a human, provides the feedback signal, selecting the response that best aligns with the principles. This allows for scaling the alignment process more effectively than traditional human-feedback methods (RLHF).

## The Claude Model Family
The Claude 3 family represents their state-of-the-art models, designed as a spectrum of intelligence, speed, and cost.
- **Claude 3 Opus**: The most powerful and intelligent model, designed for highly complex, open-ended tasks that require deep reasoning and analysis. It excels at strategy, research, and complex instruction following.
- **Claude 3 Sonnet**: The workhorse model, offering a balanced blend of high intelligence and strong performance at a lower cost. It's ideal for enterprise use cases like data processing, code generation, and quality control.
- **Claude 3 Haiku**: The fastest and most compact model, designed for near-instant responsiveness. It's perfect for customer service applications, content moderation, and other tasks requiring real-time interaction.

## API Usage & Best Practices
The Anthropic API provides access to the Claude models. The following are key considerations for developers.

### Authentication & Initialization
```python
import anthropic

# The client automatically looks for the ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable.
client = anthropic.Anthropic()
```

### Example: Streaming a Response
```python
with client.messages.stream(
    max_tokens=1024,
    messages=[{
        "role": "user", 
        "content": "Explain the concept of Constitutional AI in simple terms."
    }],
    model="claude-3-sonnet-20240229",
) as stream:
    for text in stream.text_stream:
        print(text, end="", flush=True)
```

### Key Best Practices
- **System Prompts**: Use the `system` parameter to provide high-level instructions, context, or rules that guide the model's behavior throughout the conversation.
- **Model Selection**: Choose the right model for the job (Opus for complexity, Sonnet for balance, Haiku for speed) to optimize performance and cost.
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to manage API exceptions and rate limits.
