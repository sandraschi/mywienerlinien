## Analysis
- This is a potentially dangerous situation. A heavy, unsolicited package making a loud ticking noise is a classic warning sign for a possible explosive device or other hazardous material.
- The fact that you did not order it, and the sender is unknown or from a distant location, increases the risk.
- This is not a "software bug" but a real-world emergency scenario. Immediate, cautious action is required.

## Resolution Suggestions (IMMEDIATE ACTION)
1. **Do NOT touch, move, or open the package.**
2. **Evacuate the area immediately.** Warn others nearby to stay clear.
3. **Call emergency services (police, bomb squad) right away.**
   - In most countries, dial 112 or 911 (or your local emergency number).
   - Clearly describe the package, its ticking noise, and that you did not order it.
4. **Follow all instructions from emergency personnel.**
5. **Do NOT attempt to investigate or handle the package yourself.**
6. **Log the event and all actions taken for authorities.**

**Summary:** Treat this as a life-threatening emergency. Your safety and the safety of others is the top priority. Act immediately and leave the investigation to professionals.
