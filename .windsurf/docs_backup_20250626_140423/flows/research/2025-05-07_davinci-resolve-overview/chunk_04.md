# Example: Batch Smart Editing with Magic Cut/Scene Detection

This script uses DaVinci Resolveâ€™s Python API to automate scene detection (Magic Cut) across multiple clips, creating automated rough cuts.

```python
import DaVinciResolveScript as dvr

resolve = dvr.scriptapp('Resolve')
project = resolve.GetProjectManager().GetCurrentProject()
media_pool = project.GetMediaPool()
clips = media_pool.GetRootFolder().GetClips()

for clip_id, clip in clips.items():
    # Run scene detection (Magic Cut)
    # Note: Actual API call may differ; Magic Cut is often run via GUI, but scripting can trigger scene detection
    clip.DetectScenes()  # If supported
    # Optionally, add detected scenes to timeline
    scenes = clip.GetScenes()  # Get detected scenes
    for scene in scenes:
        media_pool.AppendToTimeline([scene])
```
*Scene detection API support may vary by Resolve version. For advanced use, combine with manual scripting and timeline edits.*
