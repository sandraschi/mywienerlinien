# Research Flow: Increasing Fungal Pathogens in Plants and Animals

This research flow investigates the rise of fungal pathogens affecting plants and animals, with examples including Dutch elm disease, white-nose syndrome in bats, amphibian extinctions, and recent ash die-off. It also addresses modes of transmission, especially the role of insects as carriers.

## Chain of Chunks
- **chunk_01.md**: Prompt, overview, and historical cases (Dutch elm disease, white-nose syndrome, amphibian chytridiomycosis)
- **chunk_02.md**: Ash dieback, insect transmission, globalization/climate change, ecological and economic impacts
- **chunk_03.md**: Meta aspects, controversies, legal/economic/policy issues, and misuses/inadvertent consequences
- **chunk_04.md**: Recent growth, examples and case studies, recent publications (Nature, Science, arXiv, GitHub), and bibliography

Each chunk builds on the previous, providing a comprehensive, multi-dimensional view of the topic.
