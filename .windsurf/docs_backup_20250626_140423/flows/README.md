# Flows Directory Overview

The `flows` directory organizes all structured, process-driven documentation and knowledge management in the project. Each subdirectory represents a distinct type of flow—such as bug tracking, research, decision logs, or links—designed to ensure transparency, reproducibility, and collective learning.

## What is a Flow?
A "flow" is a repeatable, documented process that captures the lifecycle of a particular activity (e.g., bug investigation, research, decision-making) in a structured, version-controlled way. Flows are intended to:
- Provide traceability and context for project decisions and knowledge.
- Encourage thoroughness and critical thinking.
- Enable onboarding and knowledge transfer.

## Main Flows & Their Purpose
- **bugs/**: Tracks bug reports and their resolution, including AI and human analysis.
- **research/**: Houses in-depth research on technical, philosophical, or practical topics relevant to the project or broader field.
- **decisions/**: Logs major architectural or process decisions with context and rationale.
- **links/**: Curates and annotates important external resources.
- **rules.md**: Documents agentic coding and project rules.

## Suggestions for Improvements
- Add more flow types (e.g., feature proposals, retrospectives, user feedback).
- Standardize templates for each flow type.
- Automate cross-linking between related flows (e.g., linking bugs to research or decisions).
- Use tags or metadata for better search and filtering.

## Example Useful Flows
- **feature-proposals/**: Document new features, rationale, and acceptance criteria.
- **retrospectives/**: Post-mortem analyses after major milestones.
- **user-feedback/**: Collect and analyze user suggestions and complaints.
- **experiment-logs/**: Track experiments, hypotheses, and outcomes.
- **incident-reports/**: Document outages, root causes, and mitigations.
