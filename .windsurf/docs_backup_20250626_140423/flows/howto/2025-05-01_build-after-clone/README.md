# HowTo: Build the App After Cloning (2025-05-01)

This HowTo flow provides a step-by-step guide for developers who have just cloned the repository and want to build both the frontend and backend on a new development PC. Each chunk covers a logical part of the setup process, from prerequisites and tool installation to troubleshooting and agentic coding best practices.

## Chain of Chunks
- **chunk_01.md**: Prerequisites, cloning the repo, installing frontend and backend dependencies ([link](chunk_01.md))
- **chunk_02.md**: Building/running frontend and backend, troubleshooting, agentic setup tips ([link](chunk_02.md))

---

For each new setup or onboarding scenario, create a new subdirectory in `docs/flows/howto/` with its own chunked guide and README. This ensures that even complex or evolving HowTos remain well-organized and easy to follow.
