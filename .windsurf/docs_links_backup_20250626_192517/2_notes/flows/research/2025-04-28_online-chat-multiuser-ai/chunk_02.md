## 4. Repo-Aware AI: Technical Foundations

A repo-aware AI is an agent that can access, parse, and reason about the entire codebase or research project in real time. Key requirements include:
- Secure, read (and possibly write) access to the repository
- Ability to parse code, documentation, issues, and commit history
- Context retention across multi-user, multi-turn conversations
- Fine-grained permissions and privacy controls

**Current Technologies:**
- Codeium, Copilot, and ChatGPT can access code context per session, but lack persistent, multi-user memory
- Enterprise solutions (e.g., Sourcegraph Cody) are starting to offer org-wide code intelligence
- Custom bots can be built to bridge chat platforms (Slack, Teams) and code repos, but require significant engineering

## 5. Use Cases in Codebases and Research Projects

- **Code Review:** AI mediates between multiple reviewers, suggests improvements, and tracks discussion points
- **Design Debates:** Teams can debate architecture, with AI surfacing relevant patterns, anti-patterns, and prior decisions
- **Onboarding:** New contributors ask questions; AI answers using repo knowledge and project lore
- **Literature Review:** In research, AI finds, summarizes, and contrasts relevant papers for the group
- **Live Troubleshooting:** AI helps debug in real time, referencing code, logs, and prior incidents

## 6. Human-AI Interaction Patterns

- **Turn-Taking:** AI participates as an equal, responding to direct questions or flagged comments
- **Summarization:** AI summarizes debates, decisions, and action items
- **Fact-Checking:** AI verifies claims against the repo or external sources
- **Mediation:** AI resolves disputes by referencing code or documentation
