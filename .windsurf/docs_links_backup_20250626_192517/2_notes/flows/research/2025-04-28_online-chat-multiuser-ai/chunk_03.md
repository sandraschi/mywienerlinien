## 7. Challenges and Limitations

- **Context Management:** Maintaining a shared context across many users and long conversations is technically demanding
- **Scalability:** Real-time code parsing and context retention for large repos is resource-intensive
- **Security & Privacy:** Granting an AI access to sensitive code or research data raises compliance and confidentiality issues
- **User Experience:** Overwhelming chat volume, unclear turn-taking, and "AI spam" can reduce productivity
- **Tool Integration:** Bridging chat, code, and documentation platforms is often brittle and requires custom engineering

## 8. Contrasting Opinions and Ethical Concerns

**Proponents argue:**
- AI can democratize expertise, making advanced code review and research accessible to all
- Multi-user AI chat fosters creativity, rapid consensus, and better documentation

**Critics caution:**
- Risks of groupthink, over-reliance on AI, and loss of critical human debate
- Privacy concerns if AI logs or exposes sensitive project information
- Potential for AI-generated misinformation or bias in technical debates

**Recent Debates:**
- ACM Queue (2024): "AI in the Code Review Loop" [https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3621002]
- Wired (2023): "The Future of Work Is AI-Mediated Collaboration" [https://www.wired.com/story/ai-collaboration-workplace/]
- arXiv: "Conversational Agents for Collaborative Software Engineering" [https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04567]
