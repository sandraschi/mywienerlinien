## 9. Future Directions and Recommendations

- **Deep Integration:** Build seamless bridges between chat, code, and documentation platforms
- **Persistent AI Memory:** Develop AI agents with long-term, multi-user, multi-turn memory scoped to the project
- **Fine-Grained Permissions:** Allow teams to control exactly what the AI can access, log, and share
- **User Experience Design:** Research optimal UX for multi-human+AI chat (threading, notifications, summarization)
- **Ethics & Transparency:** Require clear disclosure of AI participation and logging
- **Open Standards:** Advocate for open APIs and protocols to enable interoperable, repo-aware AI agents
