# Robotic Whimsy Project (2025-05-06)

This project explores the playful, meta-aware, and potentially world-altering intersection of virtual agentic flows (AI dashboards, meme generators, webshops) and real-world tools (robots, 3D printers, loudspeaker trucks, drones, etc.).

## Directory Structure
- builder.md — Project purpose, features, risks, and meta commentary
- analysis.md — Design, risk, and architecture analysis
- actions.md — Implementation steps, logs, and next actions

## Modules
- Virtual/Physical Orchestration
- Robot Flashmob Orchestration
- Loudspeaker Truck Control
- Drone Mission Control
- Meme & Placard Generator
- 3D Print Job Submission
- Safety, Consent, and Opt-out Mechanisms

See each file/module for details. This flow is rulebook-compliant and meta-aware.
