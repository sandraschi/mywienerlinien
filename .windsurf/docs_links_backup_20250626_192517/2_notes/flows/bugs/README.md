# Bug Flows

This directory contains structured documentation for bug reports and their resolution. Each subdirectory documents a single bug, including:
- The original bug report (`bug.md`)
- AI and/or human analysis (`ai_analysis.md`, `analysis.md`)
- Timeline, attempted fixes, and resolution status

## How to Use
- Create a new subdirectory for each bug, named with the date and a short description.
- Follow the format of existing entries for consistency.
- Use clear, factual language and include logs or screenshots as needed.

## Suggestions for Improvements
- Add a template for bug reports and analysis.
- Track links to related research or decisions.
- Include a status field (open, in progress, resolved).
